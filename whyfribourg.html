                        The Château Saint-Germain, located in the centre of Gruyères' historic site, holds one of the world's oddest museums. 
                        The exhibition, dedicated to the works of Swiss artist Hans Ruedi Giger (born 1940), transports viewers to a fascinating and terrifying science fiction environment. 
                        The artist's private collection is housed in a huge room. Known for his futuristic creations, the Graubünden artist and illustrator 
                        rose to prominence after taking part in the production of the film "Alien," for which he created the monster and won an Oscar in Hollywood in 1980.

                        It was constructed in memory of his buddy and racing driver Jo Siffert by the current Fribourg artist.

                        Jean Tinguely deserved the international acclaim he has achieved, and his works may be found in various European

                        Fribourg's Urban Golf: an exciting activity similar to minigolf and swingolf, excellent for parties or families. 
                        The game is simple: point out, shoot, and tatlize the least shots with a 3-faced golf club, a ball, 
                        and a road map in your hand.

                        The Gottéron valley, whose dark side was so feared in the Middle Ages — legend had it that a dragon 
                        dwelt there – housed both blacksmiths and millers. It was located just outside of town, on the right bank, 
                        and was a perfect location for boisterous activities or those that required being close to a river without 
                        bothering the neighbours. 
                        It was in this valley that the Old Town's young people established Fribourg's first hockey club.

                        The <strong>Place du Petit-Saint-Jean</strong> serves as the starting point for this circular trek. 
                        Cross the Bern bridge, which was built in 1250 and has been restored on a regular basis since then. 
                        Continue up the Rue des Forgerons, past the ramparts. The trail then follows the river into a wooded 
                        avine. If you're lucky, you might spot the chamois that have made their home on the molasses cliffs. 
                        Return to the Schürmatt farm, which stands on an open plateau, after visiting the historic Ameismühle mill. 
                        The path goes on through farmland and woodlands. In Bourguillon, use the cantonal road for a few hundred metres to the footpath beside the mediaeval tower. 
                        Cross the Bern bridge again at the Auberge de l'Ange to return to your starting point.

                        Fribourg's exceptional mediaeval splendour is attributed to the city's surviving walls and over 200 unique Gothic facades. 
                        The old town, like an open-air museum, is best explored on foot.

                        The Cathedral of Fribourg, with its breathtaking stained-glass windows, is a sight to behold. 
                        It was dedicated to St. Nicholas and was built in phases beginning in 1283. 
                        Its 74-metre-high tower provides a breathtaking panoramic view. 
                        Fribourg's funiculaire is likewise well-known. The funicular, which connects the lower and upper parts 
                        of the city, is powered by waste water. This thriving academic town is a cosmopolitan micro-metropolis. 
                        Boutiques, antique shops, student cafes, 
                        and eateries providing regional specialties along the narrow lanes.

                            Espace 1606 is the name of the most recent mediaeval attraction. 
                            Fribourg may now be viewed as a 3D model thanks to this workshop. 
                            The model is based on Martin Martini's 1606 city map. 
                            The 52m2 model delves into the rich history of the city created by the Zähringen family. 
                            The 14-metre-high city walls, as well as the more than 7,000 various elements, such as people, 
                            buildings, trees, and bridges, will astound viewers.

                            It demonstrates how well the fortifications of the ancient town have held up since the Middle Ages. 
                            From April to October, there is no admission fee to see the city walls.
