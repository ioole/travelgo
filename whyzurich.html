                        The most clubs in Switzerland, one of the most famous shopping streets, and a plethora of cultural 
                        offerings. And all of this takes place against a mediaeval background. 
                        The Old Town of Zurich is a social, cultural and historical main destionation.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Zurich's Medieval houses, contorted, narrow lanes, and Renaissance guild and town halls provide an 
                        appealing backdrop for world-class entertainment. Special tour of Zurich's Old Town allows visitors to learn 
                        about the city's varied history. The backdrop becomes a living history of notable structures and the people 
                        who lived and acted out their lives in them. Zurich's landmark is the <strong>Grossmünster</strong> (Great Minster) with its 
                        twin towers. According to legend, <strong>Charlemagne</strong> built the towers on the site where the city saints Felix and 
                        Regula's graves were discovered. The Peterskirche (Peter's Church), which has Europe's largest clockface, 
                        and the <strong>Fraumünster</strong> are also worth seeing.
