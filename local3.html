                        <p>Sitting atop a hill which was a rubber estate earlier, the Kellie&rsquo;s Castle was built

                        <li>Three Concubine Lanes of Ipoh Old Town</li>
                        <img src="images/local3/oldtownipoh.jpg" alt="Old Town">
                        <p>In 2015, Ipoh Old Town was such a quiet town that travellers would call it a laid-back town with cafes, traditional coffees and food and flourishing street arts. Not much was heard of the three Concubine Lanes. In July 2016, Lonely Planet listed Ipoh as one of the best Asian destinations to visit. Photos of the Concubine Lanes started appearing in news articles.</p>

                        <b>Why "Concubine" Lanes?</b>
                        <p>According to a signboard along Concubine Lane, after a fire destroyed the old town in 1892, the town 
                         was rebuilt with lanes of shops. A mining tycoon, Yao Tet Shin, gave three lanes to his three wives as gifts. Each of his wives would collect rents from the shops in her own lane.</p>

                        <ol id="lane">
                            <li>Wife Lane &ndash; Lorong Hale (大奶巷)</li>
                            <li>Concubine Lane &ndash; Lorong Panglima (二奶巷)</li>
                            <li>Second Concubine Lane &ndash; Market Lane (三奶巷)</li>
                        </ol>

                        <p>If you try to translate directly from the Chinese characters, you will be confused by the numbers. 
                        "First concubine" is of course the "wife", and the "second wife" is called the "concubine and "third wife" is the "second concubine".</p>

                        <h3>Wife Lane</h3>
                        <img src="images/local3/wifelaneipoh.jpg" alt="Wife Lane">
                        <p>Seeing that this is the lane that belongs to the wife, you might expect it to be the longest lane, 
                        or the most vibrant.However, this lane is quieter than the other two lanes. he lane is not long and 
                        has a single mural of a fruit seller with his cart. The only thing of interest here is the mural of a 
                        fruit seller. Do buy some fruits from him, he needs to pay rent to the "wife".</p>

                        <h3>Concubine Lane</h3>
                        <img src="images/local3/concubinelaneipoh.jpg" alt="Concubine Lane">
                        <p>Concubine Lane, along Lorong Panglima, is the busiest among the three lanes today with shops, 
                        restaurants and a boutique hotel. Apart from Restoran Wong Koh Kee, all the other shops are new &ndash; 
                        around one year old.</p>

                        <p>The lane is usually not crowded on weekdays. Some shops will also have their off-days on certain weekdays. On weekends, all shops will be opened but the lane will also be full of people, both locals and tourists.</p>
 
                        <p>The best way to avoid crowds is to skip the weekends, and visit Concubine Lane on two weekdays to skirt around the off-days of the shops. This will work if the shops do not rest for two days consecutively in a week.</p>

                        <p>Some of the <em>old houses</em> are restored to what it used to look like in the old days. The setup in the photo (below) looks like the second level of an ancient Chinese brothel. The only thing that is missing are girls waving their silk scarfs behind the windows.</p>
                        <img src="images/local3/oldhouseipoh.jpg" alt="Old House">

                        <h3>Second Concubine Lane</h3>
                        <img src="images/local3/secondconcubinelaneipoh.jpg" alt="Second Concubine Lane">
                        <p>Unlike Concubine Lane, the Second Concubine Lane (or Market Lane) does not have many shops, except for Nam Chau Coffee Shop, which serves curry noodle, and iJuicy, a shop selling fruit juices, at one end of the lane. The red and white umbrellas hovering overhead are unique to this lane only.</p>

                        <p>If you have time, check out <em>iJuicy</em>. This shop has some rather unique decors, using red paint to write words on its window &ndash; a method that is often used by loan sharks to demand payments for overdue debts. "欠债回水" means to "repay debt with water".
                        The "water" in iJuicy is probably fruit juice.</p>
                        <img src="images/local3/juiceipoh.jpg" alt="Shop">

                        <p>Other than the two shops, the lane has three murals. The first mural depicts scene in a coffee shop, which is aptly painted on the wall outside <em>Nam Chau Coffee Shop</em>. The second one has kids jumping with joy. This is the hottest jumping spot during weekends.</p>
