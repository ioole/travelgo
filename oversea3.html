                        Changdeokgung Palace was always the preferred royal residence. It's where the king and 
                        royal family lived their daily lives.</p>
                        <p>The palace isn't just a single building, it's a complex of buildings, and each served a
                        different purpose. Some are accommodations, some are libraries, dining rooms, and meeting
                        rooms, among other uses. Be sure to spend some time in the 78-acre Huwon, or palace garden, 
                        located behind the palace. It's filled with pathways, green spaces, pagodas, streams and lakes.</p>

                        beaches and resorts. There's a lot of culture and history here, too. Be sure to visit the
                        <em>Beomeosa Temple</em> and the hillside village of Gamecheon. Gamecheon is a European-style village
                        on the cliffs above the sea, like Korea's version of Santorini.</p>
                        
                        <p>Seafood lovers should be sure to visit <em>Jagalchi Market</em>, the country's largest commercial

                        that will cook up your purchase, so you can eat it right here.</p>

                        Munmu (reign 661~681) of the Silla Kingdom (the kingdom mainly occupied the Gyeongsang-do

                        <p>Jeju Island, also known as the "Island of the Gods," is a popular vacation spot for Koreans and foreigners. It remains the top honeymoon destination for Korean newlyweds. Despite attempts to market the island as "the Hawaii of Korea," climatologically and geographically it bears little in similarity to the Hawaiian Islands in the U.S. The island offers visitors a wide range of activities: hiking on <em>Halla-san</em> (South Korea's highest peak) or Olle-Gil (routes), catching sunrises and sunsets over the ocean, riding horses, touring all the locales from a favorite television K-drama, or just lying around on the sandy beaches.</p>

                        <p>Hallasan Mountain, the highest mountain in Korea at 1,950 metres above sea level, is a must-visit entry on your Jeju itinerary. See the mysterious Baeknokdam and the majestic Hallasan Mountain's unique 4-season beauty. Hallasan Mountain&rsquo;s trails connect Gwaneumsa Temple and Seongpanak to the top of Baeknokdam, and Yeongsil, Eorimok, and Donnaeko to Witseoreum and South Wall Junction.</p>
                                
                        <p>Each trail&rsquo;s topography has a different degree of difficulty and length so choose the one that matches your physical strength.

                        <p>The Jeju Stone Park is an ecological hub that uses local volcanic stones to evoke 
                        the island's history and mythology. Sculptures scattered around the park depict 
                        various roles like guarding tombs, protecting the house, and repelling evil and 
                        misfortune. There's also a beautiful stone pagoda, a pond and a section of forest 
                        filled with sculptures, which add to the mystical atmosphere.</p>
